 it returns "Legend.AwesomeClass". If you are only interested in the "real" class name, use this method.

 Swift access for NSObject's instance method `performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:`

 @param object The argument to pass to the method when it is invoked. Pass nil if the method does not take an argument.
 @param delay The minimum time before which the message is sent. Specifying a delay of 0 does not necessarily cause the selector to be performed immediately. The selector is still queued on the threadâ€™s run loop and performed as soon as possible.
