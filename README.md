YZLibrary
=========

This is the code that helped me in the past few years of iOS development.

## Install
Using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/):

`pod 'YZLibrary'`


## Some sample usage

```objc
NSArray *fruitArray = @[@"Apple", @"Banana", @"Cherry"];
NSString *fruitForToday = [fruitArray yz_randomObject];
```
